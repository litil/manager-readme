### Motivation for this document
To help newcomers join the team, I decided to follow what the best managers have been doing for a few years now and quickly explained who I am, how I work and what are my expectations. This document won't be enough for you to deeply know me or understand how to efficiently work at Aircall but it's a good starting point.

### My role
My role is first to lead the team towards our common objectives. I try to make sure that everyone clearly understands what the team is responsible for and what it has been asked to deliver. To do so, I try to build, with the product team and the other tech teams, a clear, ambitious yet realistic roadmap for the coming months. 

Another part of my role is to help you grow as a teammate. I'm here to help you as much as I can during your onboarding process, introducing you to key people in the company. After a few weeks, you'll have a good understanding of our industry, where Aircall stands in it and what's your role at Aircall. I'll also help you diving into our product(s) by progressively assigning more complex tasks to you. Here again, after a few weeks or months, you'll be confident and efficient while working on our codebase.

Finally, I am responsible for retaining people and hiring new teammates. As for retaining people, I must be honest here, I don't follow a plan nor have a strategy. It's not a problem I have right now, but if you have some experience or ideas in that domain, I'm all ears. Regarding hiring new teammates, I try to involve the team as much as possible. I strongly believe that the soft skills are equally if not more important than the hard skills. That's why I try to make the candidate meet the whole team.

### What do I value most?
Here's a non exhaustive set of values/skills I do really like: humility, transparency, honesty, kindness/candor, eager to learn...   

As our team is working on the core product of the company, we're in the middle of a lot of conversations and providing the correct information everytime could be a challenge. To help me, don't be afraid to over communicate and be honest and transparent. Failing is accepted, hiding failures is not. So evertime you're working on a task, please keep the team and I informed of your progress, don't let us in the dark.

Another thing that I value a lot is understanding what's the business expects from us. Keeping in mind that we're building features or fixing issues for the end users, not to please our managers. We do build a product that is used, daily, by thousands of clients. So don't rush a PR into production if you know that an edge case is not covered. Raise your hand, defend your point and we, as a team, will try to fix the issue the best way possible.

_What is my process for handling conflicts? (and how you can do it yourself)_

I come from an engineering background. So when I see one of your task that I could do way faster than you, I sometimes take it from you instead of helping you with it. I try to erase this behaviour but it comes back, from time to time, especially during stressing periods. A slightly related issue that I have is delegating. As my job is to know what's going on in our products, I struggle to completely let go important features or tasks. Do not hesitate to tell me when you think I don't delegate enough.

### How/when do I work?
I am a strong advocate of fully or partially remote work as I focus way more easily at home than in the office. That being said, I love working in a team and try to involve as much as possible other team members by scheduling workshops, pair coding or pair reviewing sessions...

I will, by default, decline all meetings before 10am, between 12pm and 2pm, and after 6pm. You can schedule a meeting with me at any time, just check my calendar. I do like that you ping me on Slack when you do it, as I might see the email notifications a few hours later.

Here's how I split my day, most of the time:
* 8am: I check Slack and emails, I try to answer to the most urgent messages
* 9am to 10am: I focus on tasks blocking other team members such as code reviews, releases, reviewing specs...
* 10am to 10:15am: standup
* 10:15am to 10:30am: small break
* 10:30am to 12pm: I usually spend most of the morning in meetings
* 12pm to 2pm: lunch break. I usually work until 12:15pm or 12:30pm and get back to work before 2pm but I like to have 2 hours without meeting and enjoy some time with my family or friends if I can.
* 2pm to 6pm: it's usually split into 2. A few meetings, for 2 hours. A block of 2 hours to focus on complex tasks. Please do not schedule anything during this time.
* 6pm to 7pm: I am still in front of my computer but I focus on paperwork or read articles. Nothing really important.
* 7pm to 10pm: I check Slack from time to time
* after 10pm: consider me offline. You can send me a message in the middle of the night, that's completely fine. But I'll won't answer before 8am the next day.


### My Expectations
I expect you to understand the company mission, our team objectives and your personal responsibilities. You'll have tons of questions, I want you to ask them. There is no dumb question, so don't be afraid.

As said above, I want to be aware of any difficulties you're facing at work. We're doing team work here, so you're problem is my problem too. If you face a more personal problem, I'll also be here for you if needed. You can reach out to me at any time.

In our team, you're not "just" a coder, or a designer, or a QA, tackling tasks one after another. You're part of a team trying to improve a product, used by end users. So a task is not done when your PR is approved and merged. I expect you to keep an eye on it, help the QA validating it if needed, handle/help the release if you could and eventually communicate to your PM or I if it's an important feature.

Finally, I expect you to work and be available at least from 10am to 12pm and then from 2pm and 6pm. Our meetings are all within these timeframes, giving us a good worklife balance. 

### 1:1s

I schedule 1:1s with every member of the teams every 2 weeks. For newcomers, we do it every week until they are comfortable in the company and in the team. It could take a month or way more, it's not a problem.

Those meetings are for you: share with me your problems, ask all the questions you can think of. They usually last for 30 minutes but if we need more, we'll take more time. 

I won't come with a set of topics to discuss but you should. I strongly believe those meetings are one of the most important ones in our agenda.

### Personality quirks

I can be quite upset when someone should know about a topic (because it's within his scope or because I told him about it before) but doesn't. Same when someone doesn't fulfill his responsibility. The best way to resolve the potential conflict with me then is to acknowledge there is an issue and build a plan together to 
fix it.

I love processes and plannings. So I can be super happy when I see that a difficult task has been split into smaller chunks and that we have a good and realistic plan to tackle them.

### Where to focus on your first 90 days?
Aircall has defined an onboarding process and it will be shared with you on your first day. You'll learn a lot about the company, its history and Aircallees.
